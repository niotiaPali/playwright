One of the most competitive exams for chemical engineering graduates in India is the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), which is conducted jointly by the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). GATE is a screening test for admission to postgraduate programs in engineering and science, as well as for recruitment to public sector undertakings (PSUs).
 
To prepare for GATE, chemical engineering aspirants need a comprehensive and concise source of study material that covers the core subjects of the discipline. One such source is the book series "GATEway to Chemical Engineering" by M Subbu and his co-authors. This series consists of five volumes that contain elaborate notes, objective type questions with reasoning, and problems with solutions. The series is based on the solutions to the GATE-CH questions from 2000 to 2018, as well as some selected questions from other streams of GATE.
 
The first volume of the series covers process calculations and thermodynamics, which are essential topics for any chemical engineer. The second volume covers fluid mechanics, mechanical operations, and mathematics, which are important for understanding fluid flow and separation processes. The third volume covers heat transfer and mass transfer, which are involved in many unit operations such as distillation, absorption, extraction, evaporation, drying, etc. The fourth volume covers reaction engineering and process control, which are crucial for designing and operating chemical reactors and plants. The fifth volume covers process economics, equipment design, and chemical technology, which are relevant for estimating the cost and feasibility of chemical projects.
 
The book series "GATEway to Chemical Engineering" by M Subbu and his co-authors is a valuable resource for chemical engineering students who want to crack GATE and pursue their higher studies or careers in this field. The books are written in a clear and concise manner, with plenty of examples and illustrations. The books also provide tips and tricks for solving GATE questions quickly and accurately. The books are available for purchase from online platforms such as Amazon.in and Flipkart.com, as well as directly from the publisher Rishal Publications.
 
M Subbu is a chemical engineering educator who has been teaching this subject for over 25 years. He has authored several books on chemical engineering, such as "An Insight into Chemical Engineering", "Chemical Process Calculations", "Mass Transfer Operations", etc. He also runs two websites www.msubbu.in and www.msubbu.academy that provide free class notes and self-paced courses on chemical engineering subjects.
